Since our app simulates the use of a fitness band like
Microsoft Band or FitBit Charge HR,
we would like you to experience how it would be to use one of these
fitness bands. 

That's why we leave here an API so you can simulate that you have a fitness band. Please, 
follow the next steps.
1)First of all, you need to install Ruby on Rails. You can download it here: http://http://rubyonrails.org
2)You need to install some important gems. You will do this by using the command "gem install gem_name":

gem install 'mechanize'
gem install 'logger'
gem install 'cgi'
gem install 'time_diff'
gem install 'nokogiri'
gem install 'pusher'
gem install 'sinatra'

Note: If the command doesn't give you response, please use the command "sudo gem install gem_name". This way you can use the super user option. 

3)Now that you have the gems you can run the API. Please, go to the console and run the command 'ruby api01.rb' in the root of this project. Follow the instructions, remember that you have to be at http://fitrackucb.herokuapp.com/ to see the results.
